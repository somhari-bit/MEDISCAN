        ### *Glioma*
        **Symptoms:**
        - Headaches: Often severe and may worsen with activity or in the early morning.
        - Seizures: Sudden onset of seizures is common.
        - Cognitive or Personality Changes: Memory problems, confusion, and mood swings.
        - Nausea and Vomiting: Often due to increased pressure in the brain.
        - Weakness or Numbness: In the limbs, often on one side of the body.
        - Vision Problems: Blurred or double vision.
        - Speech Difficulties: Trouble speaking or understanding speech.

        **Recovery Strategies:**
        - Surgical Removal: When possible, surgical resection of the tumor is the first line of treatment.
        - Radiation Therapy: Often used after surgery to kill remaining cancer cells.
        - Chemotherapy: Drugs like temozolomide are commonly used.
        - Targeted Therapy: Drugs that target specific aspects of cancer cells.
        - Physical Therapy: To regain strength and mobility.
        - Speech Therapy: If speech is affected.
        - Psychological Support: Counseling and support groups to cope with emotional impact.

        - Hearing Loss or Ringing in the Ears: If the tumor affects the auditory nerves.

        - Memory Loss: Mild memory problems or changes in cognitive function.
        - Weakness in Limbs: Often on one side of the body.

        **Recovery Strategies:**
        - Observation: Small, slow-growing meningiomas may just be monitored.
        - Surgical Removal: Primary treatment for symptomatic or growing meningiomas.
        - Radiation Therapy: Used post-surgery or for inoperable tumors.
        - Stereotactic Radiosurgery: A precise form of radiation that targets the tumor.
        - Physical Therapy: To regain strength and mobility.
        - Occupational Therapy: To adapt to changes in function.
        - Cognitive Rehabilitation: To improve memory and thinking skills.
